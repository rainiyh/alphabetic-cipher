# alphabetic-cipher
Software and Computer Security final project  
Current status: Phase II  
Project group: 1

This is a cracker for an alphabetic cipher. Here is one solution, which will be tested against others for performance and accuracy.
Usage: python3 cracker.py
If you wish to test your own string, first generate it using: python3 encoder.py "Your text here"
Do not leave out the quotation marks. This will generate an encoded string and update the test file with this encoded string.
Then, run python3 cracker.py, and check the results.
